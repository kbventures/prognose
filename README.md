## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, NPM, Node.js, Gulp, Git, Github, cPanel , Google Cloud & PHP

It is my first website contract and I designed it based on the client's specifications, content, and the type of customers he was targeting. It is mobile-friendly and responsive. 

## Optimizations

This website has no maintenance contract.

## Lessons Learned:

In retrospect, I wish I had convinced my client to use Netlify for hosting since the client's hosting provider doesn't offer the ability to deploy GitHub projects directly when updates are made.

There should have been a better font responsive strategy used. CSS font system should have been used and REM measurements should have been used only for fonts and vertical spacing.

Gulp should have been replaced with webpack or npm scripts in combination with build packages since it is easier to use.
